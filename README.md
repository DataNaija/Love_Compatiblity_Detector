* Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number. 
* For Love Scores **less than 10** or **greater than 90**, the message should be:
- Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."` 
# For Love Scores **between 40** and **50**, the message should be:
- Your score is **y**, you are alright together."`
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

- "Your score is 47, you are alright together."
- "Your score is 125, you go together like coke and mentos."
